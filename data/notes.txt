A few notes about R-scripts and data.

Data:
The collected data (results.csv) is described in thesis, but to clarify
the first column in data indicates the group of test pattern which was used with
the particular participant. The test pattern is a certain randomised pattern of anti-aliasing
 methods and their settings, for example "FXAA, TAA, 4xMSAA, FXAA, 2xMSAA, TAA...".

Scripts:
manipulation.r was used to execute manipulation tests and analysis.r for analising.
Both described in thesis.
